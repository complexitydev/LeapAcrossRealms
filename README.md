# LeapAcrossRealms
Updated and fixed version of Realm Hop Asisst. 

Refer to commit https://github.com/tomrus88/BlizzardInterfaceCode/commit/c5c750e3600603cb103c180ea6fe9c9d6c04f757 for the reason Realm Hop Assist broke. 

It appears the original author is busy personally, so I figured I'd fix it up for everyone that wants it.

# Install
If you already have Realm Hop Assist, just go ahead and replace the file contents of RealmHopAssist.lua with mine. If not, download the old broken version and replace it with mine.
